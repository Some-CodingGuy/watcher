Discord bot for self.dev community

## Main Idea
The main idea is to have a discord bot that solves all our co-working needs and provides some interesting data about the same, (long suggested very cool).
So for now, having a pingable co-worker role and some interesting data would be nice.

Tech Details

- Python for scripting
- MongoDB for storing the data
